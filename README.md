# Trailing Hover Grid Effect

A React-based grid component with a trailing hover effect, built with **Tailwind CSS**. This project demonstrates a modern, interactive UI feature suitable for portfolios, landing pages, or any project aiming for a visually engaging user experience.

This effect takes inspiration from the designs at [DASH](https://thisisdash.com/), combining clean, responsive styling with interactive hover elements.
